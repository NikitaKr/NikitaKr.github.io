  Hi, I am Nikita and I am beginner in QA field. I already have some experience as a QA specialist and I would like to pursue my career in the technology. I am mainly skilled in manual test case preparation, basic QA tools and bug tracking. 
  Through different work experiences, I have also developed such skills as teamwork, dedication and analytical thinking, which I believe are beneficial when working as a QA.
